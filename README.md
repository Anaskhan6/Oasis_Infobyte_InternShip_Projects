# Voice Assistant, Password Generator, and Weather App with Python

This repository contains Python-based projects featuring graphical user interfaces (GUIs), offering a user-friendly experience for interacting with their core functionalities.

## Projects

**1. Voice Assistant**

Purpose: Provides a streamlined way to interact with your computer using voice commands. It can handle basic tasks, offer information, and potentially control devices.

Fetches the current time and date
Performs web searches directly from voice input
Potential for future expansion (smart home control, API integrations, etc.)
